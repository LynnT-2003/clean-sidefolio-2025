Starting a new project, either alone or with a team, can always be inspiring and bursting with motivation. You have your entire workflow thought out, UIs drawn out, and maybe even your business ideas locked out. However, a few weeks later, you find yourself either bummed out or burnt out as issues naturally arise, which is an inevitable result of developing a tech product.

In my latest project with MahaVertex Real Estate, my team and I had an identical issue. We were left bummed out when our thought out architecture for backend didn’t work out as planned, and the frontend faced several bugs in making the website fully responsive across all devices. These issues significantly slowed down our progress and dampened our agility, turning the once smooth development process into a frustrating slog.

It was during this low point that we truly realized the importance of project management. While tech problems are inevitable, how you address them is what defines the trajectory of your project. This is why project management is extremely crucial and understanding different methodologies are detrimental towards the success of a tech startup or a product.

As we faced issues, the team together with I, decided to hold an urgent meeting at a nearby cafe and talk out about all our problems onsite.

We decided to reset our approach and adopt a strict Agile methodology. This was a stark contrast to our earlier, more laid-back approach, which had felt like a friendly group effort but lacked the structure we now realized we needed.

By implementing Agile, we introduced bi-weekly sprint meetings where tasks were assigned clearly and tracked systematically. Each sprint included planning sessions to outline what needed to be done, followed by retrospectives to reflect on what had been completed, what hadn’t, and why.

This feedback loop helped us regain our momentum. Working on tasks in parallel while staying aligned through consistent communication allowed us to accelerate our progress. Slowly but surely, we brought our vision to life, overcoming the obstacles that had previously slowed us down.

It was through clear communication, proper project management, and a discipline in continuous development that enabled my team and I to be able to successfully finish the app exactly the way we initially envisioned as a team.
