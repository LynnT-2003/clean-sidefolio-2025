Cloud Computing and AWS is a highly valuable skill to start building your profile and career; and it is never too late to start.

## Introduction

In this article, I won't be talking much about why or why you shouldn't deploy your apps on AWS compared to existing hosting services. Instead I will be showing you how the most beginner-friendly way to start deploying your first app onto AWS professionally.

In this tutorial, we will be deploying our Next.js application to AWS EC2 using Docker & GitHub Actions, and also setting up a simple reverse proxy server using NGINX without diving in too much. In a future article, I will be writing on how to fully set up NGINX for custom-named domains and HTTPS transactions.

## Setting up our Project

### 1.1. Creating our Next.js App

To get started, we will first need an existing Next.js application. If you don't have one, we can start by creating a new sample app by running the following command in our terminal:

```
    npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-aws-demo
```

Once we have our Next.js, just leave it as be for now. We will now move onto our AWS Configuration. In this tutorial, we will be using AWS EC2 for our deployment.

### 1.2. Install Docker

We will be using Docker in this tutorial. Follow these steps to install Docker on your system:

Option 1: Using Homebrew (for macOS)

```
brew install --cask docker
```

Option 2: Download Docker Desktop

## Setting up our AWS Instance

### 2.1. Create an EC2 Instance

Head over to the EC2 Dashboard and launch a new instance.
Let's name our instance <b>nextjs-aws-demo</b> and select <b>Ubuntu</b>.

We will choose <b>t2.micro</b> as our instance type since it is free for new users.

Add in a <b>key pair</b> for a secure connection. Create a new one if you do not have one.

If you already have an security group of your own, you can <b>Select existing security group</b> and customize the rules to your preferences.

If you do not have one, choose <b>Create security group</b> and select:

<b>
  - Allow SSH traffic from <i>Anywhere</i>.
</b>

<b>
  - Allow HTTP traffic from the Internet<i>.</i>
</b>

Note: We will not be covering an HTTPS connection in this tutorial.

After successfully launching your new instance, head into your instance click <b>Connect</b>. If you have followed along correctly, you should be able to get a successful connection and gain access to the terminal for your instance in the AWS console.

### 2.2. Install Docker on AWS EC2

```
# Update and install Docker
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker.io

# Start Docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Enable Docker to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Adjust Docker socket permissions
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

# Verify Docker installation
docker --version
docker ps

```

## 3. Set up Github Actions for Automation

### 3.1. Create a Runner in Github

Go to Settings > Actions > Runners. Then click on <b>New self-hosted runner.</b>:

Follow the documentation provided while moving on with this tutorial.

### 3.2 Set up Runner in AWS

Create a new directory for our runner. Navigate to the directory, install the latest runners package, and extract the package.

```
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
curl -o actions-runner-osx-x64-2.321.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.321.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.321.0.tar.gz
tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.321.0.tar.gz
```

### 3.3 Configure and Connect Runner

Connect our newly created runner to our AWS console. Make sure to use your Github Repository URL and Token.

```
./config.sh --url https://github.com/ABC/RepositoryDEF --token ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP
```

Give a name for your runner as <b>ec2</b> and set to <b>Default</b> for the rest of the prompts.
If you have correctly followed along the tutorial so far, congratulations. You should be able to get this result:

```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Authentication


√ Connected to GitHub

# Runner Registration

Enter the name of the runner group to add this runner to: [press Enter for Default]

Enter the name of runner: [press Enter for ip-172-31-30-107] ec2

This runner will have the following labels: 'self-hosted', 'Linux', 'X64'
Enter any additional labels (ex. label-1,label-2): [press Enter to skip]

√ Runner successfully added
√ Runner connection is good

# Runner settings

Enter name of work folder: [press Enter for _work]

√ Settings Saved.
```

You should now be also able to see your newly created runner status as <b>Idle</b> under Github > Actions.

## 4. Set up Docker for Dockerization

### 4.1. Create new repository on DockerHub

Go to DockerHub's website, sign in, and create a new repository.

<img src="/aws/create-repo.png" alt="" nextjs-docker />

### 4.2. Dockerize our Next.js app

Go back to your NextJS app Code Editor, and create a new directory under your app:

```
nextjs-aws-demo
    |-.github
        |-workflows
```

Create a new <b>Dockerfile</b> under your app:

```
nextjs-aws-demo
    |-Dockerfile
```

```
// Dockerfile

FROM node:20-alpine3.18 as builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]

```

Go to your Github Repository and add in env secrets for your app if any. Make sure to add in your <b>Docker Username</b> and <b>Docker Password</b> as follows:

<img src="/aws/secrets.png" alt="env secrets" />

Go back to your Code Editor and under the workflows directory, create a <b>cicd.yaml</b> file. This will be for our CICD pipeline.

```
// cicd.yaml

name: Deploy Next.js application

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Create .env file
        run: |
          echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY }}" >> .env
          echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN }}" >> .env
          echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID }}" >> .env
          echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET }}" >> .env
          echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID }}" >> .env
          echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID }}" >> .env

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t itslynn/styleforge-lynn:latest . // Replace this with your actual repository
      - name: Login to DockerHub
        run: echo ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }} | docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} --password-stdin

      - name: Publish image to DockerHub
        run: docker push itslynn/styleforge-lynn:latest // Replace this with your actual repository name

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Pull image from DockerHub
        run: docker pull itslynn/styleforge-lynn:latest // Replace this with your actual repository name
      - name: Delete old container
        run: docker rm -f styleforge-lynn-container
      - name: Run Docker container
        run: docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name styleforge-lynn-container itslynn/styleforge-lynn // Replace this with your actual repository name

```

### 4.3. Push to branch

Once everything is completed, push your latest changes to Github, and our runner should start doing its thing after detecting a commit.

The runner will start 2 jobs in sequential as defined in our cicd.yaml, <b>build</b> and <b>deploy</b>.

It will start by creating an env file by copying the secrets we have defined, build a Docker Image of our entire app, login to our DockerHub account, and publish our app's Docker Image to our DockerHub. This entire process is called building.

Once we have successfully created and published the Docker Image of our Nextjs app, the next step is to deploy.

Now our runner will pull the published image from DockerHub, delete the old container, and run the latest Docker container on our exposed port 3000 of our AWS EC2 endpoint as defined.
